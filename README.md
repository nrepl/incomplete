# incomplete

A simple Clojure library providing code completion.
The library was extracted from nREPL's codebase and
aims to replace [clojure-complete](https://github.com/ninjudd/clojure-complete).

`incomplete`'s name refers to its basic nature and modest goals.
It doesn't aim to compete with the gold standard for completion [compliment](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment).

## Rationale

`clojure-complete` has several long-standing bugs and hasn't seen much love in recent years.
Still, the project is extremely popular due to its simplicity and the fact that it's
bundled with tools like Leiningen and REPLy.

`incomplete` started its life inside nREPL, as the provider of nREPL's built-in code
completion, but I decided it might be a useful standalone library as well.
It sits somewhere between `clojure-complete` and `compliment` in the sense that it has
more features (and less bugs) than the former, and it's much simpler and less capable than the
latter.

Here's a list of the `incomplete`'s advantages over `clojure-complete`:

* better completion of Java instance and static members
* keyword completion in Clojure
* candidate metadata (useful for tool authors)
* cleaner codebase (subjective, of course)

The long term goal for the project is to replace `clojure-complete` in REPLy and Leiningen.

## Usage

You need only one function from incomplete's API - `completions`.

``` clojure
(require 'incomplete.core)

;; var completion
(completions "map")
({:candidate "map", :type :function}
 {:candidate "map-entry?", :type :function}
 {:candidate "map-indexed", :type :function}
 {:candidate "map?", :type :function}
 {:candidate "mapcat", :type :function}
 {:candidate "mapv", :type :function})

;; ns completion
(completions "incomplete.co")
({:candidate "incomplete.core", :type :namespace}
 {:candidate "incomplete.core-test", :type :namespace})

;; keyword completion
(completions ":v")
({:candidate ":val", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":valf", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":valid", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":validator", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":value", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":var", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":var-form", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":var-name", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":var-params", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":var-query", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":varargs", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":vector", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":vector-long", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":verbose", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":verbose?", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":version-string", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":versions", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":via", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":volatile", :type :keyword}
 {:candidate ":volatile-mutable", :type :keyword})

;; static method completion
(completions "Integer/re")
({:candidate "Integer/remainderUnsigned", :type :static-method}
 {:candidate "Integer/reverse", :type :static-method}
 {:candidate "Integer/reverseBytes", :type :static-method})

;; instance method completion
(completions ".to")
({:candidate ".toBinaryString", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toChars", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toCodePoint", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toDegrees", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toHexString", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toIntExact", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toLowerCase", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toOctalString", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toRadians", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toString", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toTitleCase", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toUnsignedInt", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toUnsignedLong", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toUnsignedString", :type :method}
 {:candidate ".toUpperCase", :type :method})
```

By default the function operates on the current ns (`*ns*`), but you
can also specify an explicit namespace.

``` clojure
(completions "ma" 'clojure.core)
```
